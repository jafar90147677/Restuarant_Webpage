Hi! To access the secure website, you need to install this certificate:

1. Download: rootCA-for-friends.pem
2. Double-click it (Windows) or follow instructions in FRIEND_HTTPS_ACCESS.md
3. Install it as a trusted root certificate
4. Then visit: https://192.168.1.6:18038

The certificate is safe - it's just needed so your browser trusts the secure connection.

If you can't install the certificate, use this (less secure):
http://192.168.1.6:8038
